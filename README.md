# ReadmeGenerator
This is challenge 9 for the Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp and the purpose of this project was to practice using Nodejs. I used what I learned from Nodejs to create a professional README Generator.  People who use this generator will be prompted with several questions or selections that they can complete.  When they are finished, a README.md file will be created with the information they have provided.
